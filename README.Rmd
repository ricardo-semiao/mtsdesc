The varutils R package is being developed to provide general utility functions for projects involving Vector Auto-Regressive models, with specifically the [vars package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vars/index.html).

Mainly, the functions retrieve results from _vars_ objects, manipulate them with [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and plot commonly needed ggplot graphs, in the realm of IRF's, FEVD's, predict graphs, VAR series and residual analysis.

In the future, I intent to add functions for quick (not thorough) analysis and retrieval of trends, seasonality, and structural breaks, using common methods and statistical tests. Additionally, I want to expand the package to other VAR-like objects.

**Disclaimer:** this package is in constant development, and in the most early stage of life. It hasn't been thoroughly tested and can present several bugs. Please report any problems in my email (below) or as a github issue. Thank you for the attention.
