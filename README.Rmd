The varutils R package is being developed to provide general utility functions for projects involving Vector Auto-Regressive models, with specifically the [vars package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vars/index.html).

Mainly, the functions retrieve results from _vars_ objects, manipulate them with [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), and plot commonly needed ggplot graphs, in the realm of IRF's, FEVD's, predict graphs, VAR series and residual analysis.

In the future, I intent to add functions for quick (not thorough) analysis and retrieval of trends, seasonality, and structural breaks, using common methods and statistical tests. Additionally, I want to expand the package to other VAR-like objects.

**Disclaimer:** this package is in the most early stage of life. It hasn't been thoroughly tested and can present several bugs. Please report any problems in my email (below) or as a github issue. Thank you!

## Installation

You can install the development version of varutils from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ricardo-semiao/varutils")
```

## Upcoming changes

* Define "labs" for plots legends
* More thorough tests
  - What errors to expect in `expect_error` calls
  - Directly test for elements of the ggplots returned by functions
  - More tests specifically for `test_fun()`
  - Add tests for "helper" functions
* Resolve CRAN notes related to tidy evaluation
* Reorganization of "# Initial tests" and "# Create values" sections
  - Rethink the `test` functions list scheme
* Standardization to tidyverse style code, possibly using the "styler" package
* Add more info/sections to functions documentation
* Rethink how to pass several specifications to ggplot
